# PeopleMover

Moving people one pixel at a time...

To use this application, simply download/clone the master branch, do a NuGet Package Restore, and then run in debug mode on the "PeopleMover" project (this is selected as the start-up project by default). The included database file has mock entries pre-loaded. All names have the string "name" in them, so you can return all records by searching on "name". You can also add more fake records with the "Add 10 People" button.
